K-pop, or popular Japanese pop music, has been around for over 30 years. But its history goes back much further than that. In fact, the genre&rsquo;s roots can be traced back to the early days of popular music in Japan.
First and foremost, K-pop is a genre of Japanese pop music. But it wasn&rsquo;t always so simple. At first, there were only a few popular bands that created the sound of K-pop.</p><p>Through the years, various groups have helped shape the sound and style of K-pop. Some of these include SMAP (now known as SM Entertainment), Super Junior, and AKB48. Over time, various other genres have also been added to K-pop&rsquo;s repertoire - such as J-Pop and hip hop - but K-pop remains its own unique entity.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/taiwan-drama-best/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Taiwan Drama Best - Conceptual Marketing Corporation</span></a>
