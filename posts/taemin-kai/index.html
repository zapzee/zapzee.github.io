But its history goes back much further than that. In fact, the genre’s roots can be traced back to the early days of popular music in Japan. First and foremost, K-pop is a genre of Japanese pop music. But it wasn’t always so simple. At first, there were only a few popular bands that created the sound of K-pop.\nThrough the years, various groups have helped shape the sound and style of K-pop. Some of these include SMAP (now known as SM Entertainment), Super Junior, and AKB48. Over time, various other genres have also been added to K-pop’s repertoire - such as J-Pop and hip hop - but K-pop remains its own unique entity.\n","wordCount":"1117","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-06-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-06-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anahi Kuhic"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zapzee.github.io/posts/taemin-kai/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zapzee","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zapzee.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zapzee.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Taemin Kai - Kai Super Superm Ten Album Release Teaser Drops Upcoming Track Gears Comeback Single Allkpop Starmometer</h1><div class=post-description>Superm drops teaser photos of kai and ten for the upcoming release of</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-06-21 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 21, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1117 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Anahi Kuhic</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#exo039s-sexy-abs-post--daily-k-pop-news>EXO's Sexy ABS Post! | Daily K Pop News</a></li><li><a href=#shinees-taemin-exos-kai-and-fxs-krystal-show-off-gorgeous>SHINee’s Taemin, EXO’s Kai, And F(x)’s Krystal Show Off Gorgeous</a></li><li><a href=#aespa-instagram-photography---nakyungkimcom>Aespa Instagram Photography - Nakyungkim.com</a></li><li><a href=#superm-drops-teaser-photos-of-kai-and-ten-for-the-upcoming-release-of>SuperM Drops Teaser Photos Of Kai And Ten For The Upcoming Release Of</a></li><li><a href=#top-20-male-k-pop-idols-that-stunning-in-crop-tops--starbiznet>Top 20 Male K-Pop Idols That Stunning In Crop Tops | Starbiz.net</a></li><li><a href=#pin-by-xᴜxɪʀᴏʟʟ-on-super-m--lucas-nct-superm-kpop-taeyong>Pin By Xᴜxɪʀᴏʟʟ⁷ On Super M | Lucas Nct, Superm Kpop, Taeyong</a></li><li><a href=#shinees-taemin-exos-kai-and-fxs-krystal-show-off-gorgeous-1>SHINee’s Taemin, EXO’s Kai, And F(x)’s Krystal Show Off Gorgeous</a></li><li><a href=#pin-on-ₖᵢₘ-ⱼₒₙg-ᵢₙ>Pin On ₖᵢₘ ⱼₒₙG ᵢₙ</a></li><li><a href=#taemin-pics-on-twitter--shinee-taemin-taemin-shinee>Taemin Pics On Twitter | Shinee Taemin, Taemin, Shinee</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Korean beauty is a popular culture in the Asia Pacific region that emphasizes natural, unyielding look.

K-pop, or popular Japanese pop music, has been around for over 30 years. But its history goes back much further than that. In fact, the genre&rsquo;s roots can be traced back to the early days of popular music in Japan.
First and foremost, K-pop is a genre of Japanese pop music. But it wasn&rsquo;t always so simple. At first, there were only a few popular bands that created the sound of K-pop.</p><p>Through the years, various groups have helped shape the sound and style of K-pop. Some of these include SMAP (now known as SM Entertainment), Super Junior, and AKB48. Over time, various other genres have also been added to K-pop&rsquo;s repertoire - such as J-Pop and hip hop - but K-pop remains its own unique entity.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/suk-ku/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Suk Ku - Antonio Inoki</span></a>
