Koreans have their own unique way of looking at movies, which can be seen in the way they make and consume movies. This unique perspective has led to some defining features of Korean cinema that are often difficult for other cultures to understand. One such feature is the reliance on audience Participation. In Korean films, audiences are typically allowed to choose what happens next in order to ensure their own level of involvement in the story. This allows for a more personal experience for viewers, who can often identify with the characters and their struggles. Another defining feature of Korean cinema is its focus on artistry over realism. While other films may use realistic techniques to create an emotional impact, Korean films usually rely on surrealism and abstraction to tell their stories effectively.\n","wordCount":"1153","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-10-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-22T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Werner O\u0026#039;Kon"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zapzee.github.io/posts/mama-2017-bts/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zapzee","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zapzee.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zapzee.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Mama 2017 Bts - 15+ Photos That Reveal Exactly How Much Bts&amp;#039;s Jimin Has Wonderfully</h1><div class=post-description>10 times bts&amp;#039;s jimin shone brighter than the stars in sparkling outfits</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-10-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 22, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1153 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Werner O&amp;#039;Kon</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#10-times-bts039s-jimin-shone-brighter-than-the-stars-in-sparkling-outfits>10 Times BTS's Jimin Shone Brighter Than The Stars In Sparkling Outfits</a></li><li><a href=#bts-unveils-concept-photos-for-jin-and-group-and-they-were-worth-the>BTS Unveils Concept Photos For Jin And Group (And They Were Worth The</a></li><li><a href=#male-k-pop-idols-with-the-coolest-earrings--kpopmap---kpop-kdrama-and>Male K-Pop Idols With The Coolest Earrings | Kpopmap - Kpop, Kdrama And</a></li><li><a href=#10-times-bts039s-jimin-shone-brighter-than-the-stars-in-sparkling-outfits-1>10 Times BTS's Jimin Shone Brighter Than The Stars In Sparkling Outfits</a></li><li><a href=#creative-production-inspirations-and-lessons-from-bts-in-kpop-pt-1>Creative Production Inspirations And Lessons From BTS In Kpop, Pt. 1</a></li><li><a href=#15-photos-that-reveal-exactly-how-much-bts039s-jimin-has-wonderfully>15+ Photos That Reveal Exactly How Much BTS's Jimin Has Wonderfully</a></li><li><a href=#bts-hyyh-era-comeback-february-2019--mad-meaning>BTS HYYH Era Comeback February 2019? – Mad Meaning</a></li><li><a href=#male-k-pop-idols-with-the-coolest-earrings--kpopmap---kpop-kdrama-and-1>Male K-Pop Idols With The Coolest Earrings | Kpopmap - Kpop, Kdrama And</a></li><li><a href=#watch-bts039s-stunning-performances-from-mama-2016>Watch BTS's Stunning Performances From MAMA 2016</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>The Future of Kpop: Expect More from these Singer and Groups

2018 has been a momentous year for K-Pop music. Following the disbandment of Baek Ji Young’s girl group 2NE1, K-Pop fans have turned their attention to new talent in the genre.
One such newcomer is SM Entertainment’s new member,Hyuna. Hyuna’s debut album has been met with critical and popular approval. She speaks to Billboard about her career, influences and what makes her stand out from other members of 2NE1.</p><p>What was your inspiration behind your debut album?</p><p>I really wanted my album to be different from any other albums out there because I feel like it&rsquo;s important that young girls everywhere hear something new and unique. I wanted my music to reflect who I am as an artist, not just 2NE1 material.</p><h2 id=watch-bts039s-stunning-performances-from-mama-2016>Watch BTS's Stunning Performances From MAMA 2016<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#watch-bts039s-stunning-performances-from-mama-2016>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cWgUXYWgXVO59kp3lWp-HE0JWgpvuCkqrTM3R-r02Zw4h6SMOPRB6Z52wLSLp6lK8FZtjlBi7HOh91zBehLa9Vr83QRGocLOlA=w780-nu-rj-l80-e365" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.FINMJCSumG7fUQWTEmW-kAHaDp&pid=15.1"' alt="Watch BTS's Stunning Performances from MAMA 2016"><p><em>Source: koreaboo.com</em></p><blockquote><p>performances.</p></blockquote><ol start=2><li>Definitions of Korean Film:
There is no one definition of Korean film. Koreans have their own unique way of looking at movies, which can be seen in the way they make and consume movies. This unique perspective has led to some defining features of Korean cinema that are often difficult for other cultures to understand.
One such feature is the reliance on audience Participation. In Korean films, audiences are typically allowed to choose what happens next in order to ensure their own level of involvement in the story. This allows for a more personal experience for viewers, who can often identify with the characters and their struggles.</li></ol><p>Another defining feature of Korean cinema is its focus on artistry over realism. While other films may use realistic techniques to create an emotional impact, Korean films usually rely on surrealism and abstraction to tell their stories effectively.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/young-k-day-6/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Young K Day 6 : Teeth Cows Bad Animal Photoshop Beasts Discover Beware Enriched Milk</span></a>
