There is no one definition of Korean film. Koreans have their own unique way of looking at movies, which can be seen in the way they make and consume movies. This unique perspective has led to some defining features of Korean cinema that are often difficult for other cultures to understand.
One such feature is the reliance on audience Participation. In Korean films, audiences are typically allowed to choose what happens next in order to ensure their own level of involvement in the story. This allows for a more personal experience for viewers, who can often identify with the characters and their struggles.</li></ol><p>Another defining feature of Korean cinema is its focus on artistry over realism. While other films may use realistic techniques to create an emotional impact, Korean films usually rely on surrealism and abstraction to tell their stories effectively.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/korean-youngest-actor/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Korean Youngest Actor : 15+ K-pop Idols You Might Not Know Are Actually Married Already</span></a>
