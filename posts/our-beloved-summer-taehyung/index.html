But its history goes back much further than that. In fact, the genre’s roots can be traced back to the early days of popular music in Japan. First and foremost, K-pop is a genre of Japanese pop music. But it wasn’t always so simple. At first, there were only a few popular bands that created the sound of K-pop.\nThrough the years, various groups have helped shape the sound and style of K-pop. Some of these include SMAP (now known as SM Entertainment), Super Junior, and AKB48. Over time, various other genres have also been added to K-pop’s repertoire - such as J-Pop and hip hop - but K-pop remains its own unique entity.\nPin By Josephine Bayer On B E A C H In 2021 | Animals, Sports, Goats Source: pinterest.com\n.\nThe rise of Kpop: How did it happen? The rise of Kpop music is a recent phenomena that has been making waves across the globe. The genre, which originated in South Korea, has become aidespread sensation in recent years with its catchy melodies and powerful lyrics. The roots of Kpop can be traced back to the late 1980s when two groups of teenage girls, Girls’ Generation and Super Junior, were popularized by South Korea’s state-run television. After their victory at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, Girls’ Generation became the toast of South Korea thanks to their catchy songs and incendiary stage performances.\nSuper Junior followed suit soon after, becoming one of South Korea’s most popular bands during the early 2000s. With members from all over the country, Super Junior quickly became an international sensation. By 2007, they had sold over 100 million records worldwide.\nPrince | Prince Tribute, Prince Rogers Nelson, Prince Purple Rain Source: pinterest.com\n.\nInfluence of Korean music on other cultures: K-Pop videos have been influential on other cultures for years.

In recent years, many countries have begun to copy Korean music as it is popularized in South Korea. This has led to different styles of music being popular in different parts of the world, and it has also given rise to new K-Pop groups that are not typically found in other cultures.\n","wordCount":"1113","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nedra Pfeffer"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zapzee.github.io/posts/our-beloved-summer-taehyung/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"zapzee","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zapzee.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zapzee.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Our Beloved Summer Taehyung : Jin Sleeveless Top Appreciation!</h1><div class=post-description>Boy next door (taekook)</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-09-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>September 1, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1113 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Nedra Pfeffer</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#purple-winter---bts-taejin-event---bengaluru---kpop-high-india>PURPLE WINTER - BTS TAEJIN EVENT - BENGALURU - KPOP HIGH INDIA</a></li><li><a href=#rumores-kim-taehyung-aparecerá-en-el-final-del-drama-our-beloved>Rumores: ¿Kim Taehyung Aparecerá En El Final Del Drama Our Beloved</a></li><li><a href=#900--방탄소년단--ideas--bts-bts-boys-bts-bangtan-boy>900+ ••• 방탄소년단 ••• Ideas | Bts, Bts Boys, Bts Bangtan Boy</a></li><li><a href=#jin-sleeveless-top-appreciation--seokjin-amino--kim-seokjin-seokjin>Jin Sleeveless Top Appreciation! | Seokjin Amino | Kim Seokjin, Seokjin</a></li><li><a href=#our-beloved-summer-ost-lyrics-wall-art-printable-poster---etsy>Our Beloved Summer OST Lyrics Wall Art Printable Poster - Etsy</a></li><li><a href=#jeon-jungkook-cute-smile>Jeon Jungkook Cute Smile</a></li><li><a href=#boy-next-door-taekook---1---wattpad>Boy Next Door (taekook) - 1 - Wattpad</a></li><li><a href=#pin-by-josephine-bayer-on-b-e-a-c-h-in-2021--animals-sports-goats>Pin By Josephine Bayer On B E A C H In 2021 | Animals, Sports, Goats</a></li><li><a href=#prince--prince-tribute-prince-rogers-nelson-prince-purple-rain>Prince | Prince Tribute, Prince Rogers Nelson, Prince Purple Rain</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>There is no one right answer to this question: who are Korean celebrities?

K-Pop videos have been influential on other cultures for years. MUSIC has always been an important part of the Korean culture, and K-Pop videos have helped to spread that music around the world.
