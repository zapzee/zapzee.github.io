This virus is believed to be spread through contact with infected animals or people, and it is spreading rapidly as more people are becoming infected. There is currently no known way to prevent infection, and the best way to prevent yourself from becoming infected is to stay out of close contact with animals and people who are also susceptible to this virus. If you can&rsquo;t avoid being in close contact with these vulnerable individuals, take steps to avoid coming in contact with the virus by washing your hands often, washing your face regularly, and avoiding close contact with animals that have been infected.</p><h2 id=goblin039s-lee-el-breaks-down-in-tears-while-recording-for-the-show039s>Goblin's Lee El Breaks Down In Tears While Recording For The Show's<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#goblin039s-lee-el-breaks-down-in-tears-while-recording-for-the-show039s>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/c3Wzn6NiPCmJ5Vb2YUUv5OFQyPtxt9r5f8Z-TJydBUBRjUQ4-Ifd__FwKM3z4X2mdXP9cP2UQJBcnJ7XB9mACobLeaCKTMA7Dw=w1200-h630-rj-pp-e365" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Wn1RdBQn3B4RWPu0t6DJkAHaD4&pid=15.1"' alt="Goblin's Lee El Breaks Down In Tears While Recording for The Show's"><p><em>Source: koreaboo.com</em></p><blockquote><p>goblin.</p></blockquote><p>It’s no secret that K-pop videos have become a popular pastime for viewers all over the world.
