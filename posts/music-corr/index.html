There&rsquo;s no doubt that K-pop has gained a large following in the past few years. Fans of the genre can watch popular videos on YouTube and see their favorite artists performing live. However, what is often left out is the history of this music genre. Asian music videos have been around for a long time, and their popularity is only increasing. In this article, we will take a look at some of the earliest examples of K-pop and why it has become so popular today.</p><h2 id=the-corrs-comeback-039sweet-little-irish-band039-wasn039t-cool---but-neither>The Corrs Comeback: 'Sweet Little Irish Band' Wasn't Cool - But Neither<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-corrs-comeback-039sweet-little-irish-band039-wasn039t-cool---but-neither>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/20/21/pg-38-corrs-1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Ot-WshZ-gWK-VLh7NDtbDQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="The Corrs comeback: 'Sweet little Irish band' wasn't cool - but neither"><p><em>Source: independent.co.uk</em></p><blockquote><p>corrs corr breathless terjemahan lagu mus neither lirik rilis ketujuh irlandesi tutti deezer irlandese tocco.</p></blockquote><p>The history of Kpop: From the early days to today
K-pop, or popular Japanese pop music, has been around for over 30 years. But its history goes back much further than that. In fact, the genre&rsquo;s roots can be traced back to the early days of popular music in Japan.
First and foremost, K-pop is a genre of Japanese pop music. But it wasn&rsquo;t always so simple. At first, there were only a few popular bands that created the sound of K-pop.</p><p>Through the years, various groups have helped shape the sound and style of K-pop. Some of these include SMAP (now known as SM Entertainment), Super Junior, and AKB48. Over time, various other genres have also been added to K-pop&rsquo;s repertoire - such as J-Pop and hip hop - but K-pop remains its own unique entity.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/lee-eun-joo/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Lee Eun Joo : Park Eun Bin H5 Dramatrailers</span></a>
