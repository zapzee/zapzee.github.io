The rise of Kpop music is a recent phenomena that has been making waves across the globe. The genre, which originated in South Korea, has become aidespread sensation in recent years with its catchy melodies and powerful lyrics.
The roots of Kpop can be traced back to the late 1980s when two groups of teenage girls, Girls&rsquo; Generation and Super Junior, were popularized by South Korea&rsquo;s state-run television. After their victory at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, Girls&rsquo; Generation became the toast of South Korea thanks to their catchy songs and incendiary stage performances.</p><p>Super Junior followed suit soon after, becoming one of South Korea&rsquo;s most popular bands during the early 2000s. With members from all over the country, Super Junior quickly became an international sensation. By 2007, they had sold over 100 million records worldwide.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/seungwoo-victon/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Seungwoo Victon ~ Hands Pretty Male Idols Domestic According Fans Kpopmap Kpop Seungwoo</span></a>
