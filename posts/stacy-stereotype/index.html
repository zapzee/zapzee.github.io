Some of these include SMAP (now known as SM Entertainment), Super Junior, and AKB48. Over time, various other genres have also been added to K-pop&rsquo;s repertoire - such as J-Pop and hip hop - but K-pop remains its own unique entity.</p><h2 id=stacy-cakap-ke-tangan--mv-teaser-2-stacy---cakap-ke-tangan---youtube>Stacy Cakap Ke Tangan : MV Teaser 2 Stacy - Cakap Ke Tangan - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stacy-cakap-ke-tangan--mv-teaser-2-stacy---cakap-ke-tangan---youtube>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TXy2nUVflAg/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.w8SBVZUeWGzLCLr6os0vVgHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="Stacy Cakap Ke Tangan : MV Teaser 2 Stacy - Cakap ke tangan - YouTube"><p><em>Source: klott-peer.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>cakap kau.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Kpop idols:
