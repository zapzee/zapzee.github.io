Historical dramas often tell the stories of Korea&rsquo;s history from the perspective of the people who lived through it. These films can be seen as a flashback to Korea&rsquo;s past or as a recounting of events from the present day.</p><p>Poetic/mythical dramas often focus on themes that are outside the scope of traditional academic research. They can be seen as pieces of poetry or mythology that have been interpreted by artists or writers.</p><p>Comedy films are often lighthearted and comedic in nature, but they can also deal with serious issues such as poverty and corruption.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://zapzee.github.io/tags/k-pop/>K-pop</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://zapzee.github.io/posts/xx-web-series/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Xx Web Series ~ Dragon Ball Series Dragonballz Shenron Years Debut July Super Nearly Wallpapertag Manhua Hong Kong</span></a>
